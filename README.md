Overview of the Analysis
The Alphabet Soup business team received a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that recieved funding over the years.
The challenge for this project was to create a binary classifier that will help to predict if the applicants that will funded by by Alphabet Soup will be successful. 
The team was challenged to create 4 items:

1. Process the nueral network data
2. Train and evaluate the model
3. Optimize the model
4. Report on the results

The initial model was not able to reach the target 75%. The accuracy for my model was 53%.

Futher attempts were a mixed bag:
Attempt #1 (removing features) came in at 71%.
Attempt #2 (adding additional neurons to hidden layers and additional layers added) came in at just 52%
Finally Attempt #3 (changing activation function of output layer was 47%.
The most effective attempt was removing features.
